## About The Project
This project allows the user to create items and customers to a database, in which they can be accessed in simple POS system which also stores transactions in the database.


## What I Learned?
In this project I learnt how to use TKinter in a Object Oriented Form, this helped me make shorter more effective code in TKinter.
I also learned the basics on sqlite3 which I used for the backend database for this project. I used SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE and DELETE commands in this project
